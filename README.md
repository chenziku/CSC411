# Project Overviews
## 1. Face Recognition and Gender Classification with Regresssion
Build a system for face recognition and gender classification, and test it on a large(-ish) dataset of faces, getting practice with data-science-flavour projects along the way. Can import things like numpy and matplotlib, but the idea is to implement things “from scratch”: cannot import libraries that will do the work!

## 2. Deep Neural Network for Handwritten Digit and Face Recognition
Build several neural networks of varying depth, and use them for handwritten digit recognition and face recognition. Can import things like numpy and matplotlib, but the idea is to implement things “from scratch”: cannot import libraries that will do your work, unless otherwise specified. Only using PyTorch for face recognition.

## 3. Fake News!
Build and analyze several algorithms for determining whether a headline is real or fake news.

## 4. Tic-Tac-Toe with Policy Gradient
Use Reinforcement Learning to train a neural network to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
